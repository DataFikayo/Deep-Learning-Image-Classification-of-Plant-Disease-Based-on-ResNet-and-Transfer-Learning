# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification-of-Plant-Disease-Based-on-ResNet-and-Transfer-Learning

In this project, I utilized deep learning architecture for plant disease classification. The dataset is multi-class in nature containing 38 classes. A custom RESNET9 model based on a residual neural network is built and compared with other state-of-the-art models. A plant disease dataset containing  87,867 images is used for the training of all the models. The results obtained from the training indicate that all models tested are efficient in the classification of plant disease with the ResNET9 model achieving the highest accuracy of 99.83%, followed closely by MobileNet with 99.35% accuracy and EfficientNet with 99.00%. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were used to evaluate the results of the experiment.

I have made this project public but I ask that you give reference if any or part of the research or codebase is used in other research.
